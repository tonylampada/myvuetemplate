# tlvuestarter

This is a fork of [webpack-simple](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack-simple) template, with a few additions of my own.

In particular, there are two things here that you might want to check out, I think those are pretty cool and really improve the development process for web applications:

* The [use of mock-apis](https://medium.com/@tonylampada/javascript-mock-api-why-you-might-want-to-have-one-232b3ba46b12#.wjbs02z48)
* The [Component Catalog](https://medium.com/@tonylampada/component-catalog-why-you-might-want-to-have-one-72ee1dc1f6b1#.zgd3w9lhx) (See a [live demo](https://tonylampada.github.io/tlvuestarter/docs.html#/view/TodoDocs))

Contrary of what `webpack-simple` says, I *do* encourage you to use this template for production projects.

### Usage

This is a project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli).

``` bash
$ npm install -g vue-cli
$ vue init tonylampada/tlvuestarter my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

### What's Included


- Styling with [Bulma CSS framework](http://bulma.io)
- [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) icons
- Simple AJAX with [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
- `npm run dev`: Webpack + `vue-loader` with proper config for source maps & hot-reload (See a [live demo](https://tonylampada.github.io/tlvuestarter/)).
- `npm run build`: build with HTML/CSS/JS minification.
- Backendless environment with [Mock APIs](#mock-apis)
- Basic mocked authentication that is easy to plug in your backend
- `npm run unit`: Run unit tests, *with coverage reports* inside `/coverage`.
- A [Component Catalog](#component-catalog)

### Mock APIs

* [api.js](https://github.com/tonylampada/tlvuestarter/blob/master/template/src/api/api.js) - your real backend calls go here (in this case we are actually consuming endpoints from Github's api, so... replace with what makes sense for your backend).
* [apimock.js](https://github.com/tonylampada/tlvuestarter/blob/master/template/src/api/apimock.js) - fake api. Have all the same methods on `api.js` but returns hardcoded-ish data build with plain javascript.

When you fire the development environment with `npm run dev`, the fake api from `apimock.js` will be used, but when you build the production version with `npm run build`, the real api from `api.js` will be used instead (this is implemented using environment variables in `webpack-config.js`)

[Why would I want to have that?](https://medium.com/@tonylampada/javascript-mock-api-why-you-might-want-to-have-one-232b3ba46b12#.wjbs02z48)

### Component Catalog

There are two SPAs here: `index.html` which is supposed to be your main front-end application, and `docs.html` which is the [Component Catalog](https://medium.com/@tonylampada/component-catalog-why-you-might-want-to-have-one-72ee1dc1f6b1#.zgd3w9lhx).

Any vue component that you create like `src/**/docs/*Docs.vue` will be automatically discovered and added to the docs app.
